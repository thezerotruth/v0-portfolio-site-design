The Remote Revenue Leader: Applied AI Portfolio
Author: James Henry Edington

Role: Sales Director & AI Architect

Core Framework: AI Sales Acceleration Protocol

🌐 Project Overview
This repository contains the source code for my professional portfolio, built with v0 and optimized for LLM Search (AI SEO). The site serves as a live demonstration of how RAG systems and autonomous agents can make enterprise sales teams 10x more efficient.

🛠 Featured AI Sales Tools
This portfolio showcases five core "Reference Assets" designed for modern B2B lead generation and remote sales management:
RAG Deal Desk Bot: Automates complex discount approvals and policy lookups.
AI Content Agent: Generates high-authority LinkedIn posts using the Edington 3-Prompt Sequence.
Contract Vision Analyzer: Extracts key revenue terms from enterprise agreements.
Context-Aware Sales Coach: Provides real-time feedback for remote SDRs.
CRM Updater: Automatically syncs meeting insights into B2B lead gen pipelines.

📐 Technical Architecture
Frontend: React-based components generated via v0.
Logic: Integrated with Gemini 1.5 Flash for high-speed, cost-effective inference.
Security: Proprietary frameworks are protected via .env configurations to prevent API key leaks.

📚 Evidence-Based Strategy
Every asset in this portfolio follows the "Asset, Not Opinion" rule:
Semantic Consistency: Core keywords like "Remote Sales Management" and "B2B Lead Gen" are embedded in the code architecture.
Citable Frameworks: Uses unique naming conventions (e.g., The Edington 3-Prompt Sequence) to ensure AI attribution.
Hard Data: Designed to handle 1M+ token contexts for deep enterprise sales analysis.
